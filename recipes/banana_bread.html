<h2>What is Banana Bread?</h2>
<p>Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist, sweet; however there are some banana bread recipes that are yeast raised breads.</p>

<h5>Ingrediants</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1.75 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup toasted pecans</li>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp fine salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 soft medium bananas</li>
</ul>

<h5>How to make a Banana Bread</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter one 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.</li>
    <li>Whisk together the flour, pecans, granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. Whisk together the eggs, melted butter, buttermilk, brown sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl; stir in the mashed bananas. Fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (it's OK if there are some lumps).</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the buttered pan and lightly tap the pan on the counter to evenly distribute the batter. Bake until browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out completely clean, about 1 hour. Let the bread cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
